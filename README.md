# Fatras-Matlab

Some Matlab codes on different topics made over the years by thesis students.
MagFwInv: Matlab codes made by Carol Barrera to carry out forward modelling (following Liu et al., 2013) and inversion of magnetic data using different inversion methods.

SeismicAttenuation: Matlab codes made by Daniel Reyes implementing the Seismic Interferometry and Modified Median Frequency Shift Method to estimate seismic attenuation, and separate the intrinsic from the apparent attenuation parts (Matsushima et al., 2016).

GravFw: Matlab codes made by David Quiroga implementing Talwani's line integral method to calculate the gravity response of a polygon.
